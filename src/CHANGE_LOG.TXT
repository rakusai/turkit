
-------------------------------
version 0.2.6

- bug fix: qualifications should work now
- soap arguments are now packaged up as XML in JavaScript, rather than Java

-------------------------------
version 0.2.5

- bug fix -- MTurk REST API craps out for HITs with a very long "question" field, so we use SOAP API instead,
	which POSTs the data.

-------------------------------
version 0.2.4

- bug fix -- now loads JavaScript files using UTF-8

-------------------------------
version 0.2.3

- bug fix -- if turker responses contained "{"'s, then TurKit would complain

-------------------------------
version 0.2.2

- fixed a couple bugs with S3 API

-------------------------------
version 0.2.1

- got documentation for MTurk and S3 APIs to show up (moved them out of "utils")

-------------------------------
version 0.2.0

- hot-keys
	- Ctrl-R to run
	- Ctrl-Shift-R  to run repeatedly
	- Ctrl-S to stop
	
- added property "repeatInterval" to adjust how many seconds to wait before re-running

- export is now recursive (zips up subdirectories as well)
	- put an "_" in front of the names of any directories you don't want to export

- much smaller
	- dropped dependence on
		- Amazon's MTurk Java API
		- jetS3t
		- most of apache commons (except commons-cli) 


-------------------------------
version 0.1.44

- export command exports directories as well
	- you can hide directories from this process by
		making their name begin with either a '.' or a '_'

-------------------------------
version 0.1.43

- export command hides the Amazon keys from *all* .js.properties files,
	not just the one associated with the currently running file


-------------------------------
version 0.1.42

JavaScript

- printed call stacks are better now (before they sometimes pointed to places that re-threw exceptions, as opposed to the original exceptions)

- createHIT nows warns you when you pass keys to it that it doesn't understand

- approving and rejecting assignments without a message should no longer give people the message "undefined"

- files put into S3 now get random names, instead of their original file names
	- this is done so that TurKit processes using files with the same names do not conflict with each other...
		- perhaps each TurKit process should have it's own bucket? hm...
		
- added Stats.js with basic statistics functions

- TraceManager a little more efficient (uses queryRaw)
	- added peekFrame function to return information about the current frame
	
- utils
	- added "group", "fold", "Set", "Bag" and "jsonPath"

- added queryRaw function, that runs non-side-effecting queries (essentially "reads" as opposed to "writes" to the JavaScript database)
	
Java UI

- "Run Repeatedly" should now stop if the program runs through without throwing any "stop" exceptions

- added confirmations before deleting HITs from the Tools menu

- export command improved
	- doesn't export "turkit.properties"
	- and more... I think it is more consistent about changing workerId's

Java

- added utility function for reflectively listing resources

- fixed threading bug
	- sometimes "Run Repeatedly" would deadlock, and now it doesn't.. or shouldn't

- added Apache commons-math-2.0.jar (because 10mb isn't big enough ;)
	- this has support for t-testing, among other things
	
- minor refactorings and code optimization

-------------------------------
version 0.1.36

- efficiency improvement to waitForHIT:
	if you had a 100 "attempt" calls all waiting on different HITs,
	it used to be that TurKit would need to make 100 calls to MTurk, to check on each of them;
	now it makes one call to getReviewableHITs,
	and caches this value for 1 minute,
	so that subsequent calls to waitForHIT can check against the cached list of reviewable HITs.
	
- s3.putString now generates random names for S3 objects, rather than using the md5 hash.
	The reason for this is that you might create S3 objects in two separate projects which happen to be identical,
	and it seems fine at first to let them share the same name on S3,
	until one of those projects decides that it is done with the object, and deletes it from S3,
	without the other project knowing about it.

- added "Export" option under the "Tools" menu,
	this has the effect of creating a zip out of your code, database, and any other files in the same directory,
	AND, it also randomly changes all the workerIds found in the database,
	so that you may feel more comfortable sharing this file with other people,
	without violating the privacy of turkers.
	To be more precise, it changes the workerId's found in the database wherever they appear in any files put into the zip file.
	All workerId's are changed consistently,
	so if a single worker did all your HITs,
	then all the worker Ids will be the same.

- bug fix: the maxHITs safety counter now counts HITs rather than assignments

- added JavaScript utility functions: trim, and Set (which creates a set out of an array of values)

- technical
	- MTurk.restRequest now strips the XML meta tag at the top of responses from Amazon,
		since the JavaScript XML parser doesn't like it
	- added restRequest method to TurKit.java
	- bug fix: FileNotFound exception thrown from JavaScript was causing weirdness
	

-------------------------------
version 0.1.35

- the TurKit jar can now be executed in headless mode using commandline options

-------------------------------
version 0.1.34

- added function to write a string to a file (called write)
- added function called "read" which is the same as "slurp"
- the "read" and "slurp" functions can now read from a URL


low level stuff:

- created MTurk.java, which will eventually replace reliance on Amazon's Java API,
	hopefully reducing the size of the JAR by quite a bit.

- added function "rethrow" to JavaScript API
	- this function keeps the original stack trace of the exception,
		making bugs easier to find
		
- added utilities for converting Base64 encoding (used by MTurk.java)

- minor bug fixes:
	- highlightDiff now works with empty-string parameters
	- task-template.html now adds a hidden form parameter, if you don't add any,
		so that MTurk doesn't complain about there not being any form parameters.

-------------------------------
version 0.1.33

- function added to JavaScript API called getFile that accepts a relative path name,
	and returns a Java File object. The path is relative to the directory containing the JavaScript program.
	This function is now used internally in functions like slurp and s3.putFile.
	NOTE: you can also access the directory of the JavaScript program using the new global variable: baseDir.
	
- the print function now prints json if the thing you are printing is an object

- bug fix: the open dialog now shows folders, so that you can navigate places

- bug fix: the build.xml now creates the necessary output directory
	(which happened to exist on my own machine).

-------------------------------
version 0.1.32

- added new pane showing HITs and S3 Objects created by the current TurKit program,
	with links that can be clicked on to open the appropriate URLs in a separate brower.
	
- S3 functions now support the notion of a default bucket,
	which is created by concatenating together your AWS access key ID, and the string ".TurKit".
	For example, it will look something like 8XAF98FASHGJVVWE.TurKit.
	The putString method now also supports the notion of a default key,
	which is currently just the md5 hash of the string contents concatenated with ".html".
	
- bug fix: buttons weren't being disabled in IE when previewing the HIT

- bug fix: maxMoney and maxHITs now work.. hopefully.
	I finally ran a project which needed to break these limits,
	so I had a chance to discover that it still wasn't working, fix it, and test it.

- some files have been moved around

-------------------------------
version 0.1.31

- Fixed show-stopping bug in version 0.1.30, which apparently can't even run.

- bug fix: if the most recently loaded file has been deleted,
	TurKit will now default to the directory that it was in.

-------------------------------
version 0.1.30

- Loading the TurKit jar now asks you to open a JavaScript file.
	This JavaScript file will have properties associated with it,
	including the AWS access identifiers, and the current mode.
	You may set these parameters at any time,
	and they will take effect when the JavaScript file is re-executed.
	
- added menu bar with save, and tools for deleting HITs

- bug fix: reset database now removes HITs regardless of which mode they were created in
	(it knows which mode (sandbox or real) each HIT was created in,
	and it switches to that mode before deleting it, for each HIT)
	
- quitting will ask if you want to save

- bug fix: maxMoney and maxHITs are now adjustable (the values in the properties file were ignored before)

- "Reset Database" now creates a backup copy of the database before deleting it.
	this file will look something like: mycode.js.database.old2

- there are now 3 different modes:
	 * "offline" will not let you access MTurk or S3. (Good for using after an experiment is completed, and all the data is in the database)
	 * "sandbox" will let you access the MTurk sandbox, and the real S3.
	 * "real" mode accesses the real MTurk and the real S3.

- Java API change:
	- it is now possible to "reinit" the TurKit object with new parameters,
		this function will only re-initialize what is necessary based on which parameters are different from before.
		This features allows the GUI to change the mode without restarting,
		in fact, the mode may be changed programmatically using the "setMode" function in JavaScript

- JavaScript API change:
	- added "setMode" function (you probably don't want to use this, it is mainly used internally)

-------------------------------
version 0.1.29

- Java API change: TurKit.runOnce now accepts different parameters.

- JavaScript API change:
	- new "slurp" function which accepts a filename/path and returns the file contents as a string 
	- MTurk.vote now returns an additional parameter: the hit as it looked right before it was deleted

- highlightDiff moved from turkit.js to util.js (no effect visible to users, except in documentation)

- bug fix: now able to load database files of arbitrary size.
	It used to be that TurKit could not reload the database for some TurKit programs,
	if they were too large.
	
- minor bug fixes:
	- task-template.html now disables buttons as well as inputs and textareas
	- fixed problem when reseting database if no HITs had been created
	- fixed bug in mturk.deleteHITRaw, triggered when deleting a HITs where some assignments had been approved already

-------------------------------
version 0.1.27-test

- TurKit now tries to notice when you call "once" functions out of order.
	This should help catch cases where you edit your program in "illegal" ways,
	that get the program execution out of step with the memoized execution trace.

- printed messages, like "hit created" are now shown every time the program is run.
	This means you will still have access to that url that it shows,
	even if you re-run the program.

-------------------------------
version 0.1.26-test


- "Reset Database" now deletes all the HITs and S3 Objects associated with the database.
	In particular, any time you call mturk.createHIT or s3.putObject in a TurKit program,
	the HIT Id or S3 Object URL is stored in the database,
	and when the database is reset, all of these HITs and S3 Objects are removed.

- new function mturk.deleteHITRaw
- the deleteHIT functions now work better -- in general, they will always succeed at deleting the HIT,
	no matter what state it is in, even if turkers are currently working on assignments for the HIT.
	Note that all assignments that haven't been rejected for the HIT will be approved
	(this is consistent with the previous behavior).

- deleteHIT now removes the HIT from "__HITs" in the database
- "Delete HITs" button changed to "Delete All HITs" (performs same function)
- the global value "__HITs" in the database is now an object (each key is a HIT Id), as opposed to an Array

- when S3 objects are created or deleted, the new "__S3_Objects" variable in the database is updated.
	It stores the URLs for each S3 Object as a key.
	
- new function s3.getURL, useful for constructing an S3 URL based on a bucket name and a key

-------------------------------
version 0.1.25

- this was the version when the change log was created
